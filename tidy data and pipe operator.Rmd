TIDY DATA

The data where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value



```{r}
library(magrittr)
```
This is the sign of pipe
```{r}
%>% 
```

By pipe operator we can improve code by applying multiple function to have same as result with ease...example

```{r}
mean(1:20)
```
floor funtion that changes decimal to integer... ex.
```{r}
floor(10.5)
```
s0,

```{r}
floor(mean(1:20))
```
same result with pipe operator
```{r}
1:20 %>% mean() %>% floor()
```
Again
paste is function that paste the string
```{r}
paste("hello","world","rounak","lama")
```
by pipe operaor
```{r}
"hello" %>% paste("world", "rounak",  "lama")
```
